#Car Sales Dashboard
**Overview**
This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive analytics for a car dealership's sales performance. Built using publicly available car sales data from Kaggle, the dashboard delivers real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and regional performance to support data-driven decision-making.

In this project, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning directly within Power BI after importing the dataset from an Excel file. I also learned how to build effective and dynamic visualizations tailored to business requirements — incorporating interactive filtering and smooth user navigation.
