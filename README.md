# Car-Sales-Dashboard
**Overview**
This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive analytics for a car dealership's sales performance. Built using car sales data from Kaggle, the dashboard offers real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and regional performance to support data-driven decision-making.

In this project, I learned how to clean data directly in Power BI after extracting it from an Excel file, and how to visualize data based on the company's requirements â€” with effective use of filters and smooth, user-friendly interaction.

to run this project: 1- download powerbi
                    2- opwn the powerbi file CarsSalesDashboard.pbix
